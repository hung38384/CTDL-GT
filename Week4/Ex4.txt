? Your task is to write operations of queue data structure in pseudo-codes using a linked list, then evaluate the complexities of the operations.

Struct:
    data
    next

front = nullprt
behind = nullprt

Function isEmpty():
    return (front == nullprt)

Function enqueue(element):
    newNode = Create a new Node with 'element'
    If (isEmpty()):
        front = newNode
        behind = newNode
    Else:
        behind.next = newNode
        behind = newNode

Function dequeue():
    If (isEmpty()):
        Print "Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue."
        Return null
    Else:
        element = front.data
        front = front.next
        Return element

Function size():
    currentNode = front
    count = 0
    While (currentNode != null):
        count = count + 1
        currentNode = currentNode.next
    Return count
