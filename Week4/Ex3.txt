? Your task is to write operations of queue data structure in pseudo-codes using an array, then evaluate the complexities of the operations.


queue[SIZE]
front = 0
behind = -1

Function isEmpty():
    return (behind < front)

Function enqueue(element):
    If (behind = SIZE - 1)
        print "Queue is full. Cannot enqueue."
    Else 
        behind = behind + 1
        queue[behind] = element

Function dequeue():
    If (isEmpty())
        print "Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue."
    Else
        element = queue[front]
        front = front + 1;
    return element

Function size():
    return (behind - front + 1)
